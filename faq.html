                This is the independent video game called <span class="bg">&quot;bob's game,&quot;</span> a massive adventure RPG.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is the brainchild of Robert Pelloni, a reclusive, self-taught game maker &quot;prodigy.&quot;
                <br>
                All content- concept, writing, graphics, music, and programming were created by him.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="bg">&quot;bob's game&quot;</span> is a work of satire about gaming and the game industry, where the main character <span class="yuu">&quot;Yuu&quot;</span>
                <br>plays games inside the game to find <i>the greatest game ever made</i> - the legendary <span class="bg">&quot;bob's game.&quot;</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                This virtual <span class="bg">&quot;bob's game&quot;</span> <i>inside</i> of <span class="bg">&quot;bob's game&quot;</span> is created by the in-game end boss character <span class="bg">&quot;bob,&quot;</span> the author's <i>alter-ego.</i>
                <br>
                <span class="bg">&quot;bob&quot;</span> is a villainous, egomaniacal mad-genius developer who believes he has uncovered a <i>vast conspiracy</i> in the game industry to hold back great games.
                <br>
                <br>
                Believing himself on a quest to save the game industry, <span class="bg">&quot;bob&quot;</span> holds an interdimensional <span class="bg">&quot;bob's game&quot;</span> tournament-
                <br>
                in order to gather every brainwashed gamer worldwide together at once and break the <i>evil spell of shovelware.</i>
                <br>
                If <span class="yuu">&quot;Yuu&quot;</span> wants the industry to survive- <span class="yuu">&quot;Yuu&quot;</span> must beat <span class="bg">&quot;bob&quot;</span> at his own game... and <span class="yuu">&quot;Yuu&quot;</span> might just reveal the <i>real truth.</i>
